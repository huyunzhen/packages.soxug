#
# You can specify a list of AD to NTLM domain mappings with this parameter. Useful in cases

# Prevalidated users.  Disconnected authentication based on saved

#
# In order for a user to be prevalidated, the user must have a
# Service Principal Name (SPN) set in the form of:
#   preval/user
# Where 'user' is the User Logon Name, which can be  either
#  1. name part in the user's UPN, if the domain part matches the user's domain.
#  2. samAccountName, if UPN is empty or UPN's domain part is different from user's domain;
# and 'preval' is the service name specified by the
# adclient.prevalidate.service parameter below.
#
# By default, no users are prevalidated.
# If you specify either
#   adclient.prevalidate.allow.users or
#   adclient.prevalidate.allow.groups parameters,
# only those users will be prevalidated, with the exception of
# users specified in
#   adclient.prevalidate.deny.users and
#   adclient.prevalidate.deny.groups
# If you wish to include all users in the zone without any
# exceptions, set adclient.prevalidate.allow.groups to the string 'all@zone'.
#
# CAVEAT: The deny users/groups settings are useless without settings in allow
#         user/groups. In other words, a settings for deny only makes sense if there
#         is a setting for allow.
#
# For example, the attributes could be used as follows:

#   adclient.prevalidate.allow.groups: admins
#   adclient.prevalidate.deny.users: bsmith
#   adclient.prevalidate.deny.groups: contractors

# This policy is used if the agent is unable to connect to its primary domain

# controllers and try each server in the list up to the maximum number of
# servers you specify. For example, if you have a large number of replica
# domain controllers for a given domain, you may want to use this parameter
# to limit the number of servers for the agent to try to connect to in order

#
# Specify the full path of dzdo validator.
#
# Dzdo validator is a customized executable program or script, which is called
# by dzdo to perform validation check before running privileged commands. The
# customized validator program or script must return zero for success, non-zero
# for failure. Validator will take AD user name (user@domain
# format), command, run as user, run as group and dzdo role, that he/she is
# trying to execute. All these information can be configured through environment
# variables DZDO_USER, DZDO_COMMAND, DZDO_RUNASUSER, DZDO_RUNASGROUP
# and DZDO_ROLE respectively.
#
# Dzdo only trusts and runs the validator owned by root and not group/world
# writable. When the return value of validator is non-zero, dzdo will not
# execute the privileged command. Dzdo will not print any message to console or
# log about the validation result. Validator should log its messages by itself.
#
# When the validator is not available or not trusted, dzdo will ignore the
# validator, and continues to run the privileged command by default. We can
# alter this behavior by configuring parameter dzdo.validator.required. When
# enabled, dzdo will not execute the privileged command if the validator is not
# available or not trusted.
#
# The dzdo validator is located at /usr/share/centrifydc/sbin/dzcheck by default.
# This file is non-exist upon installation. A sample script is provided at
# /usr/share/centrifydc/sbin/dzcheck.sample for your reference.

#
# This parameter only specifies the generation scheme of UID and GID, if it is
# intended to generate primary group ID using Apple scheme as well, please also
# set parameter "auto.schema.primary.gid" to -1.
#
# After the parameters are set, please run command "adflush" to flush the cache
# which stored the old UID and GID for the existing users and groups. After
# "adflush" is ran, the users and groups should have their UID and GID generated
# using Apple scheme.
#
# Changing UID and GID generation scheme may cause existing home directories and
# files ownership conflict, please make use of the helper script "fixhome.pl" to
# fix the ownership conflict problem.
#
# Notice: (1) When this setting is set to true, settings specified at parameters
# auto.schema.rids, auto.schema.first.uid and auto.schema.first.gid are ignored.
#         (2) If parameter auto.schema.groups is set, please ensure the primary

#

#
# This parameter allows Auto Zone installations to designate the
# home Directory. %{user} and %{pgroup} can be used as placeholders. 
# %{user} will be replaced with a user name and %{pgroup} will be  
# replaced with a primary group name during login.

# The parameter define the user name disallowd characters.
#   The upper setting up will be invalid if it is set up without empty.
#   If both are unset or empty, use the following default value as   
#   the unsavory chars.                                              
#   You should be careful to set the values not only unsavory chars

# You must run adflush to flush the cache after changing 
# this value.
#
# Currently supported formats are:
#   SAM@domainName     - User@AD_DOMAIN    Joe@ACME.COM
#   NTLM               - DOMAIN<NSEP>User  ACME+Joe
#   SAM                - User              Joe
#
# The first 'adclient.ntlm.separators' key value
# determines the actual NTLM separator character.
#
# auto.schema.name.format: SAM

#
# This parameter allows Auto Zone installations to designate user's GID 
# to be set to the user's UID. If this value is set to false and 
# auto.schema.primary.gid is not set or set to -1. Then the user AD primary
# group will be used as the user's GID. If the user does not have an AD
# primary group then the user's GID will be set to the group "nobody". You must
# run adflush to flush the cache after changing this value.
#
# On Darwin
# auto.schema.private.group: false
# On Linux, Solaris, HPUX, AIX
# auto.schema.private.group: true
#

#
# This parameter allows administrators to use GID to specify the default primary
# group for all users in Auto Zone.
#
# The parameter value can be a non-negative integer or -1. The GID can be
# specified by setting a non-negative integer.
#
# When set to -1, the user AD primary group will be used as the user's GID. If
# the user does not have an AD primary group then the user's GID will be set to
# the group "nobody". Users' primary GID would be generated by the scheme we
# choose, like APPLE, RID or AD_VALUE. The priority of these schemes is "APPLE >
# RID > AD_VALUE". The default scheme is RID, We can switch to Apple scheme by
# setting the parameter auto.schema.apple_scheme.
#
# This parameter will be ignored if the parameter auto.schema.private.group is
# set to true. You must run adflush to flush the cache after changing this
# value.
#
# For backward compatibility, empty value will be treated as -1.

#
# auto.schema.name.lower: true

#
# This parameter limits the number of objects (user/group) that are returned 
# from searches. The number of objects (user/group) that will be returned 
# will be at least "auto.schema.search.return.max" and no more than 
# "auto.schema.search.return.max + adclient.paged.search.max"
# You must restart adclient to have this take effect.
#
# auto.schema.search.return.max: 1000

#
# This parameter specifies the Active Directory users to be included in Auto 
# Zone.
#
# By default all Active Directory users are included in the Auto zone. When you 
# enable this policy, the users specified and members of the groups specified 
# in "auto.schema.allow.groups" are able to log in using their Active Directory 
# account.
#
# You specify users by name or you can list the user names in a file. The user 
# name can be specified in any of the following formats:

# - User Principal Name: name@domain.com
# - NTLM: DOMAIN+sAMAccountName
# - Full DN: CN=commonName,...,DC=domain_component,DC=domain_component
# - Canonical Name: domain.com/container/cn
#
# If a name contains space characters, you can put the name in double quotes or 
# escape the space characters using backslashes:
# e.g. "Krusty T. Clowns", Jane\ Doe
#
# adclient writes any name that is not recognized to the Centrify DirectControl 
# log file.

#
# auto.schema.allow.users:
#

#
# This parameter specifies which Active Directory users to include in the Auto 
# Zone using group membership as the criteria.
#
# By default all Active Directory users are included in the Auto Zone. When you 
# enable a group or groups in this group policy, only the users who are members 
# of the groups specified, including members of nested groups and users whose 
# primary group is set to one of the groups specified, and all users specified 
# in "auto.schema.allow.users" are able to log in using their Active Directory 
# account.
#
# Note: This parameter does not include the group in Active Directory Auto 
# Zone, just the users in that group. This means that the group is NOT 
# automatically assigned a GID. Use "auto.schema.groups" to include a group in 
# the Auto Zone and assign it a GID.
#
# Any groups listed in this group policy can be domain local, global or 
# universal groups. The groups must be security groups; however, distribution 
# groups are not supported.
#
# You specify groups by name or you can list the group names in a file. The
